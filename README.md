**CodTech IT Solutions Internship- Basic Calculator Documentation**

**Internship Project Overview:**
- **Company Name:** CodTech IT Solutions
- **Intern's Name:** P. Sri Vaishnavi
- **Project Title:** Basic Calculator 

**Introduction:**
This documentation presents an overview and explanation of the Basic Calculator program developed as part of the Java internship task. The program allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a console-based interface. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the program's functionality, structure, and usage.

**Program Overview:**
The Basic Calculator program is a simple Java application designed to perform mathematical operations based on user input. It utilizes the Scanner class to read user input from the console and implements a switch-case statement to determine the operation to be performed. The program supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Functionality**

**Input:** Users can input two numbers (operands) and choose one of the four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

**Operations:**
- **Addition:** Adds the two input numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies the two input numbers.
- **Division:** Divides the first number by the second number. It also handles the case of division by zero.

**Output:** The program displays the result of the chosen operation.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Starting the Program**: 
    - To begin using the Basic Calculator program, you need to run the `BasicCalculator` class.
2. **Input**: 
    - After starting the program, you'll be prompted to enter two numbers.
3. **Operation Selection**: 
    - Once you've entered the two numbers, the program will prompt you to choose the desired operation.
    - You can choose the operation by entering the corresponding number:
        - Enter `1` for addition
        - Enter `2` for subtraction
        - Enter `3` for multiplication
        - Enter `4` for division
    - After entering your choice, the program will compute the result based on the selected operation.

4. **View Result**: 
    - After performing the operation, the program will display the result.

**Error Handling:**
The program includes basic error handling to prevent division by zero when performing the division operation. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates.

**Conclusion:**
The Basic Calculator program provides a simple yet effective way to perform basic mathematical operations using Java. It serves as a foundational exercise for understanding user input, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in programming. This documentation aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the program's functionality, usage instructions, and code structure.
